This is a very powerful claim that has been sought by the nonequilibrium stat mech research community for decades, and so it comes at a price: the &amp;ldquo;$\approx$&amp;rdquo; in this expression is a poorly-controlled approximation. It generally works for &amp;ldquo;[[https://rattling.org/docs/background/typicality/|typical]]&amp;rdquo; systems, but that notion so far lacks a formal definition. Some of the core questions in our research are thus understanding the assumptions and the practical generality of this approximation. #formal #general&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Calculating Rattling</title><link>/docs/background/calculating-rattling/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Dec 2024 18:53:05 -0600</pubDate><guid>/docs/background/calculating-rattling/</guid><description>&lt;p>[For context, see [[https://rattling.org/docs/background/rattling-thermo/|Rattling Thermodynamics]]]
One limitation of the Rattling framework $p_{ss}(x) \approx e^{-\gamma\; \mathcal{R}(x)}/Z \tag{1}$ is that for arbitrary far-from-equilibrium nonlinear dynamical systems, it is difficult to analytically estimate Rattling of any given state $\mathcal{R}(x)$. So we often need to explicitly measure $\mathcal{R}(x)$. This still allows us to predict global steady-state in terms of only local measurements of Rattling, and so is already practically useful, but the cases where we can predict $\mathcal{R}(x)$ analytically allow for much more prediction and control.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Landauer's Blowtorch Theorem</title><link>/docs/background/landauers-blowtorch-theorem/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Dec 2024 18:53:05 -0600</pubDate><guid>/docs/background/landauers-blowtorch-theorem/</guid><description>&lt;p>This classic no-go theorem from 1975 [[[[https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.12.636|Phys Rev A 12:636–638, 1975]]] was a response to the persistent hope in statistical physics to formulate a general &amp;ldquo;nonequilibrium Boltzmann distribution&amp;rdquo; – i.e., to express the nonequilibrium steady-state probability of any given state in terms of only &lt;em>local&lt;/em> observables at that state. Landauer showed that this is in general impossible by providing a counter-example, illustrated in this picture:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Rattling Thermodynamics</title><link>/docs/background/rattling-thermodynamics/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Dec 2024 18:53:05 -0600</pubDate><guid>/docs/background/rattling-thermodynamics/</guid><description>&lt;p>Rattling gives us a &amp;ldquo;[[https://rattling.org/docs/background/neq-boltzmann/|Nonequilibrium Boltzmann Distribution]]&amp;rdquo; (a statement that must be carefully qualified and still needs further development and clarification, see link). This is something that has been sought by the nonequilibrium stat mech community for decades, and so if we suppose that we have this, it opens many possibilities. One natural next step is to try to translate the plethora of phenomena and results known from equilibrium thermodynamics to nonequilibrium systems, and verify them on experimental and numerical examples.
