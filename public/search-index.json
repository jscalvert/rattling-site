So we often need to explicitly measure $\\mathcal{R}(x)$. This still allows us to predict global steady-state in terms of only local measurements of Rattling, and so is already practically useful, but the cases where we can predict $\\mathcal{R}(x)$ analytically allow for much more prediction and control.\nComposability of energy This can be compared to the equilibrium counter-part, the Boltzmann distribution $p_{eq}(x) = e^{-\\gamma\\; U(x)}/Z$ , where the state energy $U(x)$ can often be calculated analytically even for very complex equilibrium systems. Now notice that there is no fundamental sense in which state energy should be any more \u0026ldquo;natural\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;simple\u0026rdquo; to deal with than Rattling – the latter is in fact easier to access experimentally using only a single local measurement (by just checking the state exit rate). The main reason why energy $U(x)$ is so useful in equilibrium systems is because it is conserved (which leads to the Boltzmann distribution), and composable (which means that the energy of any complex system state is just the sum of all constituent subsystem energies and interaction energies).\nSo if there was a way to calculate the Rattling of a complex composite system from knowing something about the Rattling of the component dynamics and their interactions, then our framework would be comparable in predictive power to the equilibrium stat mech.\nComposability of Rattling? Independent systems While this is probably too much to ask in the general case, some progress can likely be made. To begin, we notice that for non-interacting subsystems, steady-state probability distribution factors, and so Rattling is indeed composable: $p_{ss}(x_{AB}) = p_{ss}(x_A)\\; p_{ss}(x_B) \\approx e^{-\\gamma\\; \\left(\\mathcal{R}(x_A)+\\mathcal{R}(x_B)\\right)}/Z$. This suggest one possible research direction:\nPerturbatively turn on weak interactions, and see how this affects the composite Rattling values, look for general principles that may extend beyond the perturbative regime. This is similar to the treatment of weakly-coupled field theories, which may, in fact, be a good example to study this on (see Anharmonic Net example [FIX link]). Stochastic systems Another example where we can use composition is if one of the systems is so chaotic that it can be estimated as state-independent noise: $\\mathcal{R}_{B} = const$, and so that interactions just serve to \u0026ldquo;raise the temperature\u0026rdquo; of the composite. This suggests another research direction:\nFor any interaction strengths, look for ways to decompose the composite system Rattling in terms of subsystem Rattlings and some additional \u0026ldquo;interaction contribution\u0026rdquo; – which we can always define as $\\mathcal{R}_{int} \\equiv \\mathcal{R}_{AB}-\\mathcal{R}_A-\\mathcal{R}_B$. The question is then whether this $\\mathcal{R}_{int}$ has some nice properties and may be analytically predicted in some cases. One hypothesis would be that it may be estimated in terms of the relationship between the symmetries in the driving force and the symmetries of the composite system state $AB$ – so in the above case of \u0026ldquo;$B$ as noise,\u0026rdquo; there are no compatible symmetries, and so $\\mathcal{R}_{int}=0$. Composing over driving force components Yet another interesting approach comes from composing Rattling not out of its subsystems, as is done with energy, but rather out of the different components of its driving force. This was successfully demonstrated in our Science paper, fig 2 and 3, [FIX link] where it allowed us to analytically predict and engineer the steady-state behaviors of a robot swarm.\n\u0026ldquo;Analytic continuation\u0026rdquo; of Rattling landscape More generally, this suggests another route to analytically predicting Rattling – by measuring it for some parameter regime of a system, and then using that to predict how the Rattling landscape $\\mathcal{R}(x)$ will evolve as we adjust the parameters.

Since at equilibrium, $p_{eq}(x) \\propto e^{-\\beta\\, U(x)}$, we have a log-normal distribution of state probabilities, whose tale thickness is controlled by the inverse temperature $\\beta$ ($\\sigma$ above is considered a system-specific constant). When the tale becomes especially thick (at high $\\beta$ = low temperature), the probability distribution becomes dominated by the few states deep in the tale of low $U(x)$. This leads to a low-entropy fine-tuned selection of microstates reminiscent of the \u0026ldquo;frozen\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;solid\u0026rdquo; phase.\nRandom Rattling Model For Rattling, we might similarly expect $\\{\\mathcal{R}(x)\\} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma)$ – but this needs to be checked more carefully [OPEN]. While energy of a state is compositional – it is the sum of all the subsystem interaction energies – the Rattling of a state does not always have this property (though sometimes it does – see here).

Here, looking for the typical distribution of Rattling in a complex system, puts us in the territory of random matrix theory: if we can assume that the correlations are so messy as to be essentially random, then we are looking for log det of a random symmetric positive semi-definite matrix. This paper showed that this may actually be Gaussian distributed – taking us back to where we started. In general, however, this will depend on the specific random matrix ensemble, and so we need to consider carefully our specific case.\nEmpirically, however, we see that Rattling does tend to be normally distributed for many complex dynamical systems. This means that the REM results carry over directly, predicting two possible phases for dynamical system steady-states: when the variance of Rattling values across system states is high, we\u0026rsquo;ll expect probability to concentrate strongly in the few least-Rattling states in the tail of the distribution. Besides giving a nice example of a Rattling-driven phase transition, this also addresses one of the core questions of this research [FIX link] – whether Rattling effects are typically strong enough to create strong fine-tuning.\n","date":"2024-12-04","id":27,"permalink":"/docs/background/random-energy-model-rem/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eOne of the simplest, and also most general, models of equilibrium phase transition is the \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_energy_model\"\u003eREM\u003c/a\u003e.

This is something that has been sought by the nonequilibrium stat mech community for decades, and so if we suppose that we have this, it opens many possibilities. One natural next step is to try to translate the plethora of phenomena and results known from equilibrium thermodynamics to nonequilibrium systems, and verify them on experimental and numerical examples. Let\u0026rsquo;s now go through a few research directions in more detail:\nEnergy vs Rattling Rattling plays the same role in non-equilibrium steady-state distributions (for typical systems) as energy does in the Boltzmann distribution. This suggests comparing properties of Rattling $\\mathcal{R}$ with those of energy, to see if $\\mathcal{R}$ can be as powerful as energy in various contexts.\nFirst notice that there is no fundamental sense in which state energy should be any more \u0026ldquo;natural\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;simple\u0026rdquo; to deal with than Rattling. Energy is more familiar to us, but ratting is in fact easier to access experimentally using only a single local measurement - by just checking the state exit rate. In contrast, there is actually no simple local way to measure the energy of a given state (partly because only relative energies are physically meaningful - so there is no absolute quantity to measure). The main reason why energy $U(x)$ is so useful in equilibrium systems is because it is conserved (which leads to the Boltzmann distribution), and composable (which means that the energy of any complex system state is just the sum of all constituent subsystem energies and interaction energies). This composability of energy often allows us to analytically calculate the energy of a state, even if we can\u0026rsquo;t measure it directly. One core question here is whether Rattling of a state is as easy to calculate as state energy. At first this seems challenging, but some progress can, surprisingly, be made – see discussion on this here for some initial steps.\nAnother property of energy that is important is that it\u0026rsquo;s locally conserved, and can flow among degrees of freedom (e.g., in the form of heat or work). Is there some equivalent of this for Rattling? This question is wide open at the moment. [OPEN] So much of our intuitions are based on energy that it\u0026rsquo;s tough to translate to the very different context of Rattling - but if we suspend our habits and take a fresh perspective, we may be surprised. If this connection can be made, it would open up the territory of heat engines (e.g., Carnot cycle) for translation into Rattling context.\nEntropy-energy tradeoff In statistical mechanics, the tradeoff between energy and entropy is responsible for many of the most interesting predictions, such as phase transitions. This can directly translate to Rattling-entropy tradeoff, since when we coarse-grain the microstate distribution $p_{ss}(x) \\approx e^{-\\gamma\\; \\mathcal{R}(x)}$, we will naturally get $p_{ss}(X) \\approx e^{-\\gamma\\; \\mathcal{R}(X) + S(X)}$, where $S(X)$ is the entropy of the macrostate $X$. We explicitly showed how this calculation can be carried out, and how it can predict the phase transition in the Vicsek model of flocking – see here. While it seemed to work in that example, the broader concept raises a core question of how Rattling acts under coarse-graining (what is $\\mathcal{R}(X)$ and how it relates to $\\mathcal{R}(x)$ in general), whether there is a preferred level of granularity where Rattling is most accurate for steady-state prediction, and how to identify such granularity in new systems. [OPEN]\nRandom Energy Model (REM) This is a very simple and general model of equilibrium phase transitions in complex systems, like spin-glasses and proteins. It carries over nicely to the case of Rattling, showing us that we can similarly expect Rattling to cause such phase transitions in a wide variety of complex driven systems, and thus create strong fine-tuned selection of few least-Rattling states. See here for details.\nRattling-energy interactions The other interesting question is what happens in driven systems that have both, a strong energy landscape over their states, as well as a Rattling landscape. For strong driving, we might expect the driving to overwhelm any internal energies, making the energy-landscape hard to even define meaningfully (since energy is not conserved). However, in practice, the driving may not be strong enough to overwhelm all energetic effects, and we can somehow usefully define it.\nIn general, we don\u0026rsquo;t expect a simple answer in these cases. Namely, we do NOT expect them to combine simply as $p_{ss}(x) \\approx e^{-\\gamma\\; \\mathcal{R}(x) - \\beta \\; U(x)}/Z \\tag{1}$. In our first paper on Rattling, we explored this question in a very simple 1D setting – and were able to verify some analytical predictions, see[FIX link]. In more complex and general contexts, this question is still open.

One natural next step is to try to translate the plethora of phenomena and results known from equilibrium thermodynamics to nonequilibrium systems, and verify them on experimental and numerical examples.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s now go through a few research directions in more detail:\u003c/p\u003e","tags":[],"title":"Rattling Thermodynamics"},{"content":"No adversarial fine-tuning other literature around typicality\u0026hellip; (e.g., random matrix theory, Wigner nuclei)\n","date":"2024-12-04","id":29,"permalink":"/docs/background/typicality/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eNo adversarial fine-tuning\nother literature around typicality\u0026hellip; (e.g., random matrix theory, Wigner nuclei)\u003c/p\u003e","tags":[],"title":"Typicality"},{"content":"Here\u0026rsquo;s a talk about the Markov chain theory of rattling that Jacob gave during a visit to the Santa Fe Institute in 2024.
