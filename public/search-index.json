More precisely, how common are systems for which the rattling of a state is highly correlated with its weight in the global steady-state distribution? While there are many examples of systems for which rattling holds in this sense, it is unclear how typical rattling is among real-world systems.\nDoes rattling work outside of the steady state? Rattling relates a local property of a state to its weight in the global steady-state distribution. The Markov chain theory of rattling shows that this local property suffices to predict the global weight of a state when the local part varies enough over the states of the system. This view of rattling may hold even when the global steady-state distribution is replaced by a finite-time distribution.\nHow does rattling relate to the dynamics of the constituents of a system? Rattling is a property of a state of a system. For systems that are groups of interacting elements, a state might consist of the positions of all the elements in the group. How can we relate rattling, a property of the state, to the dynamics of the elements the state comprises?

All we need to do is apply localized heat (i.e., \u0026ldquo;a blowtorch\u0026rdquo;) at another location, here affecting the barrier between these two wells.\nThis proves that local information is not sufficient, in general, to predict the steady-state probability (as long as we are in nonequilibrium context).\nHow Rattling circumvents this Rattling, however, claims to do just this: it predicts the nonequilibrium steady-state \\(p_{ss}(x)\\) in terms of the local Rattling value \\(\\mathcal{R}(x)\\).
