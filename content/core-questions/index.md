## Typicality of rattling

How common are systems for which the rattling $\mathcal{R}(x)$ of a state is predictive of its probability $p_{ss}(x)$ in the global steady-state distribution? 
While we have many [examples](https://rattling.org/docs/examples/) of classes of systems for which rattling holds in this sense, we still need a better evaluation of how common rattling is among real-world systems (see here[LINK Jacob's result] for our best understanding of this so far).

## Strength of rattling fine-tuning

In systems where rattling holds, can it produce a strongly concentrated $p_{ss}(x)$ distribution? 
To explain the remarkable degree of organization and order found in nature, the fine-tuning due to Rattling needs to be very strong, requiring $\mathcal{R}(x)$ to vary over several orders of magnitude. Is this possible and likely to happen in natural systems? (see [examples](https://rattling.org/docs/examples/), and specifically the discussion in [REM](https://rattling.org/docs/examples/random-energy-model/))

## Drive information encoding



## Rattling for transients

Rattling relates a local property of a state to its weight in the global steady-state distribution. The Markov chain theory of rattling shows that this local property suffices to predict the global weight of a state when the local part varies enough over the states of the system. Does this view of rattling hold even when the global steady-state distribution is replaced by a finite-time distribution?

# Other key questions

## Rattling "one level down"

Rattling is a property of a state of a system. For systems that are groups of interacting elements, a state might consist of the positions of all the elements in the group. How can we relate rattling, a property of the state, to the dynamics of the elements the state comprises? In other words, how can we go "one level down?"



## Rattling under transformations

The extent to which rattling predicts a system's steady-state distribution depends on how the states are defined. If you transform the state space, say, by coarse-graining, how does rattling change?



## Predicting rattling



## *A priori* test of rattling

Is it possible to detect the failure of rattling to predict a system's steady-state distribution from simple measurements of the system?
