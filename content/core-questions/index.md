## How common is rattling in practice?

More precisely, how common are systems for which the rattling of a state is highly correlated with its weight in the global steady-state distribution? While there are many examples of systems for which rattling holds in this sense, it is unclear how typical rattling is among real-world systems.

## Does rattling work outside of the steady state?

Rattling relates a local property of a state to its weight in the global steady-state distribution. The Markov chain theory of rattling shows that this local property suffices to predict the global weight of a state when the local part varies enough over the states of the system. This view of rattling may hold even when the global steady-state distribution is replaced by a finite-time distribution.



## How does rattling relate to the dynamics of the constituents of a system?

Rattling is a property of a state of a system. For systems that are groups of interacting elements, a state might consist of the positions of all the elements in the group. How can we relate rattling, a property of the state, to the dynamics of the elements the state comprises? In other words, how can we go "one level down?"
