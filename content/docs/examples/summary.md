Here are several entries from an ever-growing list of examples:

- [Random energy model](http://rattling.org/docs/examples/random-energy-model/). A model of a random Boltzmann distribution on configurations of +/âˆ’ spins. The configurations have energies that are independent normal random variables.
- [Random chemical reaction system](http://rattling.org/docs/examples/random-chemistry/). A model of a chemical reaction system in which a fixed number of species react with random rate constants. The maximum molecularity of the reactions is also fixed.
