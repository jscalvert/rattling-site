Here are several entries from an ever-growing list of examples:

- [Random energy model](rem.md). A model of a random Boltzmann distribution on configurations of $+/-$ spins. The configurations have energies that are independent normal random variables.
- [Random chemical reaction system](rand-chemistry.md). A model of a chemical reaction system in which a fixed number of species react with random rate constants. The maximum molecularity of the reactions is also fixed.
