A theoretical framework aimed at explaining order in nature, and specifically self-organization and adaptation in non-living dynamical systems. It is inspired by the quest to understand the general drivers of the origins of life: why non-living matter might spontaneously turn into living matter. It's a new and active area of research, with some of the [core questions](/core-questions/) having been resolved, and others very much open—[join our effort](/contact/)!


Rattling $\mathcal{R}(x)$ is: 

- a property of a dynamical system's state $x$
- related to how quickly the system "leaves" the state: 
	- for discrete systems, it is the log exit rate of a state
	- for continuous system, it is the entropy of local forces acting on the configuration
- easy to measure locally
- predictive of how likely you are to find the system in that state $x$ at long times
- useful far from equilibrium, as energy is useful at equilibrium
- related to how well state $x$ is "matched to" the system's environment
- a way to explain [order](/docs/background/explaining-order) in nature
