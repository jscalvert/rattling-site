Q: So what exactly can Rattling theory tell me for my specific system, experiment or question? How do I use it?

First you need to consider if you think the Rattling hypothesis should hold in your system. Generally, it should hold for ["typical"](/docs/background/typicality/) systems â€“ see [these guidelines](/docs/background/typicality/#general-guidelines) more specifically. 

This is a question of whether your system may be considered "typical"
