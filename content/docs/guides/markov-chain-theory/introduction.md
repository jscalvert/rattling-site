This guide explores the Markov chain theory of rattling developed in [Calvertâ€“Randall (2024)](/references/calvertrandall/). It assumes only basic knowledge of finite Markov chains, like the jump-hold description of continuous-time Markov chains and the major theorems about the existence and uniqueness of stationary distributions.
